# Spam-classification-NLP-1-project
The project involves NLP for spam classification, determining if messages are ham or spam using a dataset named spa.tsv. It is a basic-level NLP project focusing on text analysis for categorizing messages into spam or non-spam categories.

**Dataset Exploration:**
  - Read and understand the spa.tsv dataset, featuring columns like 'label', 'message', 'length', and 'punct'.
  
**Handling Imbalance:**
  - Recognized dataset imbalance and mitigated potential bias by extracting equal samples from each category for balance.

**Data Visualization:**
  - Utilized data visualization techniques to gain insights and enhance understanding of the dataset.

**Model Implementation:**
  - Employed Random Forest and SVM algorithms for predicting spam or ham messages.

**Performance Metrics:**
  - Evaluated model performance using various metrics to assess its effectiveness in classification tasks.

**Testing:**
  - Tested the model with three random message samples to validate its real-world applicability.
